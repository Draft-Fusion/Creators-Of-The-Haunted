*A game for a jam game that was not finished.*
------------------------------------------

## Getting started:
Keep in mind this is not a complete list of detailed info on this game as there are lots of details to talk about.

Input a name like Kim or whatever name you want!
Remember this game is about *resources* and *managing* ***3*** things as well as leveling up!

 - Energy
 - Health
 - Time

## Questions and Answers:
 - Q: ***Is there a end game?***
 - A: *The idea was to beat a end boss that was an evil Mage (But not yet implemented)*

 - Q: ***Did you use a game design document?***
 - A: *Nope! I never plan out my ideas, I just do them and think about them as I go.*
 - Q: ***How did you come up with the name?***
 - A: *Well It was hard but I thought about the game of Minecraft and wanted horror aspect to a text adventure game. The hard part was coming up with something that seemed reasonable to what would be fun to play. So why not a hub area and the outside of it is the scary places. Although something might come out from the shadows..*
 - Q: ***What are some of the games inspirations?***
 - A: *Minecraft, Binding of Issac, Zork, Rouge, Dwarf Fortress, 7 Days To Die, Project Zomboid, EarthBound, Zombies Are My Neighbors (Slots are inspired by EarthBound as I like only having 1 item consume 1 slot even if you have multiple it will take up another slot)*
 - Q: ***Why did you not submit the game when you "finished" it?***
 - A: *I did not realize that Java is not like C++ where you could just run the program in a cmd it required a GUI*

## Unused:
    [Poison] was going to be used as a way to get sick so you had to cure it with a pill

    [Knifes / Sharp Sticks] could be crafted with a pill to possibly make it poisonous
    [Wooden Container] was going to be used to store 6 items (Crafting it requires 2 logs + 2 Sticks)
    [First Aid Kit] can fully restore and cure all alignments
    [Skull key] was going to be used for obtaining harder to get item OR it was going to be used to goto an underground area (AKA boss labyrinth) it was not decided all together.
    [Elemental bosses] was going to be just an interesting fight like *ICE, FIRE, WATER, WIND
    [Weather Cycle] was just going to add more to the game for both story & seed growth (3-4 days for 1 to grow)
